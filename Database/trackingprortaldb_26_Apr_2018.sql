Goa is home to everything refreshing, zesty, exotic and colourful. So is its food. Goa provides a rich mix of Indian culture with Portuguese effect. Visibly different from the rest of the country, Goa has characteristic colourful houses, lush green fields and a soothing languidness in atmosphere. The charming villages of Goa are ideal for a laidback morning walk or an aimless evening stroll. North and South regions of the place are strikingly different - the former is a cultural hub with traditional eateries and markets, while the latter is a luxurious side of it with 5-star hotels, private beaches and a mix of white sand and clean blue water. Under the star-laden skies, each festivity becomes more alive. Goa greens and wildlife makes for a nature lover&#39;s ideal hotspot. Goa&rsquo;s biggest draw is undoubtedly its virtually uninterrupted string of golden-sand beaches. This shimmering strand of sand stretches along the Arabian Sea from the tip to the toe of the state, and each of the various beaches have developed their own personalities and reputations since the hippie days of the sixties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">i). Panaji&nbsp;<br />\r\nPanaji is the capital of the Indian state of Goa and the headquarters of North Goa district. It lies on the banks of the Mandovi River estuary in the Tiswadi taluka. Panaji is the first city in India to be built on a planned grid system One of India&rsquo;s smallest and most relaxed state capitals, Panaji crowds around the peninsula overlooking the broad Mandovi River, where cruise boats and floating casinos ply the waters, casting neon reflections in the night. A glorious white washed church lords over the animated city centre, a broad leafy boulevard skirts around the river, and grand colonial buildings rub shoulders with arty boutiques, old-school bookshops, state-of-the-art malls and backstreet bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">ii). Margao<br />\r\nMargao is the second largest city by population, and the commercial and cultural capital of South Goa. It&rsquo;s a useful place for shopping, catching a local sporting event or simply enjoying the busy energy of big-city in small-town form. By road, Margao is located approximately 33 kilometres from the capital Panaji, and 27 kilometres from Vasco da Gama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">iii). Mapusa<br />\r\nMapusa is a town in North Goa. It is situated 13 Kms. North of the capital Panaji. The town is the headquarters of Bardez Taluka. Mapusa is a small town clustered around the Mount Alto. Mapusa has remained a prominent market centre for many centuries. Mapusa is the largest town in northern Goa, and is most often visited for its busy Friday market, which attracts scores of buyers and sellers from neighbouring towns and villages, as well as a healthy intake of tourists from the northern beaches. Numerous charity organisations, including International Animal Rescue and El Shaddai are nearby in Assagao. It&rsquo;s a good place to pick up the usual range of embroidered bed sheets and the like, at prices far lower than in the beach resorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">iv). Pilar<br />\r\nPilar is a village in Goa, some 10 Kms. from the state capital Panaji. It is on a hill top and has a panoramic view of the Arabian Sea and the mountains all around. The site of Pilar is superb, reached by a narrow winding road that threads its way up the hill from the plains below. Set on a hill high above the surrounding countryside, is Pilar Seminary, one of four theological colleges built by the Portuguese. At the bottom of the hill is the old Church of Our Lady of Pilar, which still contains the original statue brought from Spain, along with lots of tombstones of Portuguese nobility, the grave of the locally famed Father Agnelo, and some attractive paintings in an alcove at the rear of the chapel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">v). Vasco-De-Gama<br />\r\nVasco de Gama is a city in the state of Goa. It is named after the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama. It is the headquarters of the Mormugao taluka. The city lies on the western tip of the Mormugao peninsula, at the mouth of the Zuari River. This strategically important town was formerly among the busiest ports on India&#39;s west coast. It remains a key shipping centre, with container vessels and iron ore barges clogging the choppy river mouth, but holds nothing of interest for visitors, particularly since the completion of the Konkan Railway, when Goa&#39;s main railhead shifted from here to Margao. Originally Vasco de Gama was founded by Portuguese during their rule in Goa in the year 1543 and within the short period it was established as Western India&rsquo;s busiest ports of all. Today at Sada, you see just remnants of the ramparts, actually it was the fort built by Portuguese in the same century after establishing Vasco as Western India&rsquo;s Port to control smooth operation of shipping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">vi). Mormugao<br />\r\nMormugao is a sub-district and a municipal council in South Goa district. It is Goa&rsquo;s main port. Mormugao was an important port for Portuguese ships. Mormugao is the main port facility of Goa located at the tip of a peninsula jutting out into the Arabian Sea. It&rsquo;s a 45 -minutes drive to Panjim. Close to Mormugao is the small town of Vasco da Gama. It serves as terminus for the railway line into Goa. The atmosphere is easygoing and the people are very friendly. In the oldest part of the town, the Portuguese heritage has survived remarkably well? There are narrow, winding streets, old houses with overhanging balconies and red&not; tiled roofs, whitewashed churches and numerous small bars and cafes &not; an atmosphere more reminiscent of the Mediterranean than of India. The ships are docked at Mormugao Port.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">vii). Chandor<br />\r\nThis is the village which was once the location of the capital of Chandrapur rulers which also boasts of a fort and a temple within its citadel. It is located 10 kms from the inland of Margao and has both the ancient and modern aspects to its history. The ancient Chandor was once a port of international repute and a great capital where trade and commerce flourished. Its geographical location is just perfect with the loop of the Kushavati River with another tributary of the Zuari to the west. One of the most important capitals of Chandragupta, the Mauryan Emperor, and filled with inscriptions by Bhoja kings dating back to the 3rd century, Chandor, once known as Chandrapur, has retained much of its heritage from before the Portuguese rule and 13th century temple raids. Located on the banks of river Kushavati, Chandor has been the site for excavations, with pottery dating back to 200 BC found here along with an old, ruined statue of Nandi, Lord Shiva&#39;s bull, from 7th century belonging to the era of Chandraditya in 1929. Most of these excavations are displayed at their site of discovery for the public to see. A major attraction of Chandor and a living testament to Portuguese heritage is the Bragangca House.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p style="text-align:justify">Goa has places available for all categories of travellers.

The British, under the leadership of Lord Wellesley, were the last of its conquerors, when Ahmednagar came as per the Treaty of Poona in 1817.

After periods ofPortuguese and Persian control and invasions from the ruling dynasties of Saudi Arabia and Oman, Bahrain established itself as an independent nation during the 19th century period of British hegemony. Although the current twin cities of Manama and Muharraq appear to have been founded simultaneously in the 1800s, Muharraq took prominence due to its defensive location and was thus the capital of Bahrain until 1921. Manama became the mercantile capital, and was the gateway to the main Bahrain Island. In the 20th century, Bahrain&#39;s oil wealth helped spur fast growth and in the 1990s a concerted diversification effort led to expansion in other industries and helped transform Manama into an important financial hub in the Middle East.

In fact, the city itself is now a major attraction, whether it&rsquo;s pleasure loving music festivals, fine dining or lashings of history and architecture. A UNESCO world heritage site, Lyon&rsquo;s major selling point for many visitors are its distinctive architectural hallmarks and the contrasts in its setting, between two hills and two rivers. Its centre is beautiful and it&rsquo;s enough to have snapping selfies all over the place. The riverfront is being transformed under an ambitious, six year plan to develop 48 kms of former docks. The Confluence project is now Europe&rsquo;s largest single urban regeneration mission and it include open-air cafes, promenades, viewing points, art installations and galleries as well as nature trails, museums, a huge shopping mall, tram lines and eccentric apartment blocks built like Lego houses in primary colours and blocky shapes.

From its colourful markets, like the Noailles market that makes feel like Africa, to the Calanques de Marseille miniature fjords with tall limestone cliffs down into the sea, Marseille has a lot to offer. Like many port around the world, Marseille long had a reputation for seediness and crime. And there&rsquo;s still scruffiness about the city today, which is no bad thing. It lends Marseille a rakish character and gives it an intoxicating dynamism and colour. Built on multiculturalism, revolution and a Mediterranean climate, Marseille is one of Europe&rsquo;s most intriguing metropolises. Back dropped by the white limestone cliffs of the Calanques, its serene setting is at odds with the Arabic style backstreets of the city centre and the boisterous bartering at the fish market. The hub of Marseille is the Vieux-Port, a harbour with some 2600 years of history, while adjacent neighbourhoods such as Le Panier and Belsunce still offer up warrens of washing webbed lanes, perfect for exploring on foot or by bike. The tree lined Central Avenue of La Canebiere crackles with activity day and night, while a short ferry ride offshore reveals Marseille&rsquo;s other face the Iles du Frioul, a rocky archipelago perfect for walkers and bird spotters. There are some hugely diverting museums and cultural sites back in the city centre, but a major part of Marseille&rsquo;s draw is that it doesn&rsquo;t cater solely for highbrow visitors.

It is a hi-tech showcase of modern Japan and yet it still retains the soul of traditional Japan. It manages to be extremely comfortable, even luxurious, while remaining decidedly mysterious and exotic. First and foremost, Tokyo is a food lover&#39;s paradise. Tokyo Metropolis is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the centre of the Greater Tokyo Area and the largest metropolitan area in the World. It is the seat of the Japanese government and the Imperial Palace and the home of the Japanese Imperial Family. One of the best things to do in Tokyo, especially during spring or autumn, is to take time to sample green tea and Japanese desserts and enjoy maple trees in autumn colours or blooming pink cherry trees in spring. Give rest to aching feet in the small Teahouses serving Green Tea and Japanese Desserts, walk the stepping stones around the pond, enjoy the view of a traditional Japanese Bridge. The city is appealing on many levels and offers everything from quiet gardens to nightlife. It is a city without limits in that a lifetime isn&#39;t long enough to explore everything in town. For example, Tokyo has an estimated 88000 restaurants that would take 120 years to explore at two a day. Nestled in South Eastern Japan, Tokyo boasts not only of towering sky scrapers, immaculate roads and architecture, but also of forests, traditional shrines and cherry blossoms in the spring. A combination of poetic wonder and technological marvel, Tokyo is a must visit for any tourist. The city is not all about slick business suits and traditional kimonos either, it is a thriving pop culture phenomenon for gamers, developers and anime fans alike, with its quirky technological innovations and virtual culture. Tokyo is best perceived as a collection of cities with different characters and vibes, rather than one city alone.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p style="text-align:justify">Tokyo abounds with excellent places to stay, from luxury affairs to humble budget friendly lodgings. Its glittering skyscrapers house numerous international four and five star hotels, both in the populous cultural hotspots of Shinjuku and in the business centres of Akasaka and Shinbashi. Meanwhile, hostels catering to the shoestring traveller lie scattered throughout the city. For a memorable, distinctly Japanese experience, seek out a ryokan, a traditional bed and breakfast with tatami floor mats and sliding screen doors. Tokyo has a variety of places to stay in ranging from hostels to five star hotels. One of the unique living arrangements in Tokyo is capsule hotels, which are the cheapest options.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>By Air</strong> - Tokyo has well established connections to every major city around the world, and every major airline lands at Narita Airport, the most important airport in Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>By Road </strong>- From Narita Airport, one can use the road to travel to Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>By Train</strong> - Tokyo is the centre of railways and the subway in Japan, with connections to every single city in Japan. The subway and the railways can be used with a rechargeable card, but a map is a must as some of the railways and subway lines are slightly difficult to navigate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>By Bus</strong> - Tokyo also has a good bus service, for which rechargeable cards are also available. There are intercity buses, as well as intra city bus services. Most intra-city buses require small change, so it is advisable to carry coins and JPY 1000 notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>By Water </strong>- Waterways are only applicable from island to island in Japan, so from Kyuushu one can take the ferry to Honshu to visit Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Getting Around</strong> - Tokyo has a dense network of railway lines, roads and subways all operated by different companies, under private partnership. This may be of some inconvenience to tourists as each company has a different map for its own territory. Japan&rsquo;s most prominent railways line is the JR Yamanote Line, which connects many cities together, conveniently placing Tokyo at the centre.

With every street, mountain and shrine having something to offer, Kyoto is a must visit for a rich, wholesome cultural experience. The old capital of Japan Kyoto is characterised by its deep interesting cultural roots. Surrounded on three sides by mountains, Kyoto is an incredibly tranquil place filled with more than a thousand temples, vestiges of traditional Japanese culture and gardens that change colours with the seasons. Boasting of picturesque Japanese architecture and traditional geishas, Kyoto also has a diverse range of cuisine, enough to delight the most seasoned connoisseur. Large temples dot the landscape, with every street having something new to offer, like a hidden ramen restaurant or a traditional Japanese dwelling. It is one of the most bicycle friendly cities in Japan, giving plenty of opportunities for tourists to explore Kyoto. Also made for the adventurous, it is home to many hiking trails and exploration sites, in the mountainous regions surrounding it. In conclusion, Kyoto is the best option for the relaxed tourist, who seeks to explore and discover traditional culture and adventure. Kyoto&#39;s architecture it&rsquo;s most famous feature worldwide. Japan&#39;s capital for more than 1000 years, Kyoto was the centre not only of politics, but religion, philosophy, art, culture and cuisine. All of Japan&#39;s refined cultural arts blossomed from seeds planted here including the tea ceremony, Kabuki Theatre, Zen and Tantric Buddhism. Breathtaking sights are everywhere, though some places truly stand out, among them Kyoto&#39;s great temples and the forest cloaked Fushimi Inari Taisha, a shrine pathway through a miles long chain of towering vermilion gates.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p style="text-align:justify">Kyoto spoils visitors for choice when it comes to good accommodations, offering everything from traditional ryokans to luxury Western style hotels. In a city used to receiving foreign travellers most establishments know exactly what to offer tourists and how to help newcomers to the area. To avoid paying premium prices during the cherry blossom season consider staying in Osaka located just a 30 minutes train ride away. Centrally located hotels charge more than those in the outer neighbourhoods. Kyoto&rsquo;s accommodation options range from basic guesthouses, youth hostels and temple lodgings to luxurious international hotels and top class ryokan.

The city is bounded on one side by the Kii Peninsula and is shut off from the Inland Sea to the west by the island of Awaji. Its location on the Yodo delta with its network of watercourses and canals spanned by more than a thousand bridges has, deservedly, earned Osaka the nickname &quot;Venice of the East.&quot; While the origins of Osaka date back to the mythological early days of the Japanese Empire, today the city is undoubtedly one of the most modern in Japan, boasting a futuristic skyline along with countless impressive examples of modern architecture. Its world class status is cemented by its many cultural institutions, from its superb museums and art galleries to its ultra modern entertainment, theatre and music venues. Osaka offers visitors a slew of modern as well as historic attractions. It is home to beautiful Osaka Castle, which dates back to 1583 and is one of Japan&rsquo;s most famous landmarks. From Minami&#39;s neon lighted Dotombori and historic Tenno-ji to the high rise class and underground shopping labyrinths of Kita, Osaka is a city that pulses with its own unique rhythm. Though Osaka has no shortage of tourist sites, it is the city itself that is the greatest attraction. Home to some of Japan&#39;s best food, most unique fashions and warmest locals, Osaka does not beg to be explored it demands it. More than anywhere else in Japan, it rewards the impulsive turn down an interesting side street or the chat with a random stranger. People do not come here to see the city, they come to experience it. Osaka&rsquo;s best sights are scattered far and wide, but there are some areas worth exploring on foot. A fine place to start is the castle Osakajo and its immediate environs.

For tourists wishing to stay at the centre of all activities in Osaka, Minami is the best place to book hotels in. However, for tourists staying temporarily, Kita would be ideal. The majority of Osaka&#39;s moderate and expensive accommodations concentrate in the districts of Umeda, Kyobashi, Namba and Shin Osaka. Base the stay in or near Minami neighbourhood for proximity to a wide selection of shopping and dining options.

Although more than 60 percent of the buildings in Hiroshima were destroyed, the city has managed to make an amazing recovery since that devastating August 1945 blast. In fact, by 1974, the city had actually managed to double its pre-war population, and it has also become a popular tourist destination. One of the most popular sites in this city is the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, which was created in memory of all those who lost their lives or were injured by the atomic bomb. This large park is home to several interesting sites, including the Peace Memorial Museum where visitors can see the effect the bomb had on the citizens of Hiroshima. Another must see tourist site is the great Torii, a wooden shrine gateway that appears to be floating in the sea at high tide. Travellers can visit two UNESCO World Heritage sites of the Itsukushima Shrine and the Bomb Dome in Peace Memorial Park, learn traditional craftwork at Fudenosato kobo and even explore the lush islands in the Seto Inland Sea. Today, Hiroshima is regarded as the world&#39;s peace capital and is home to such notable attractions as the Hiroshima Peace Institute as well as a number of important structures that survived the bombing, if only as ruins and which provide a sobering reminder of that fateful day. Despite this association, the city remains a vibrant, exciting tourist destination, home to great museums, galleries, and gardens, as well as important cultural events such as the Hiroshima Flower Festival, held each May since 1977 and attracting a million visitors. A tour of Hiroshima is incomplete without a visit to the memorial museum and park that detail and commemorate the horror of the bombing, as well as the flourishing city that had stood prior to it.

The ordinal hotels serve a western style bed room with some amenities including slippers and nightwear and one may be able to have breakfast for free in according to the accommodation plans.

Industry and merchant houses sprang up in the shadow of this magnificent fortress, as did pleasure quarters for samurai. Supported by taxing the rich harvests of the surrounding Nobi plain, the Tokugawa family used the castle as its power centre for the next 250 years. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, when Japan began trade with the West in earnest, Nagoya developed rapidly. When the harbour opened to international shipping in 1907, Nagoya&#39;s industrial growth accelerated, and by the 1930s it was supporting Japanese expansionism in China with munitions and aircraft. This choice of industry was Nagoya&#39;s downfall very little of the city was left standing after World War II. Thanks to its position opening onto the Pacific, Nagoya has developed into the country&#39;s busiest port and has long been an important manufacturing site of such traditional industries as ceramics and textiles. The ceramics industry was established here in the 12th century and has become somewhat of a tourist attraction thanks to its numerous workshops and factory tours. Many of the city&#39;s historic sites remain, including its 16th century castle which like much of the city centre was rebuilt after the destruction of WW-II. These days, this large city is a pleasure to visit for its excellent network of wide modern streets, museums, art galleries and historic temples. Nagoya is a city which was known in the past for its samurai and ninja culture but has fast evolved to become the hub of automobile and aircraft manufacturing in Japan. Slowly it is making its way onto the tourist map as well for those who want to get away from the city madness in Tokyo and enjoy a slightly off beaten vacation in Japan.

The town is steeped in history, and many of its 65 temples and 19 shrines date back some eight centuries, when, for a brief and tumultuous period, it was Japan&rsquo;s political and military centre. It&rsquo;s most famous sight is the Daibutsu, a glorious bronze Buddha surrounded by trees, but the town&rsquo;s ancient Zen temples are equally compelling. Kamakura is also well known for its spring blossoms and autumn colours and many temple gardens are famous for a particular flower Japanese apricot at Zuisen-ji, Tokei-ji and hydrangea at Meigetsu. Kamakura&rsquo;s prime sights can be covered on a day trip from Tokyo, but the town more than justifies a two day visit, allowing time to explore the enchanting temples of east Kamakura, to follow one of the gentle hiking courses up into the hills or to ride the Enoden line a few kilometres west to tiny Enoshima Island. In summer, the coast here is a favourite spot for windsurfing. As a religious centre, Kamakura presents an extraordinary legacy. Most of its temples and shrines are in settings of remarkable beauty many are designated National Treasures. To increase the chances of seeing Kamakura at its best, avoid coming at the weekend. The rest of the time this seaside town basks in distinctly serene atmosphere exuded by over 60 religious edifices. Kamakura, both the homeland of Zen Buddhism and firm friend of surfers, has somehow managed to reconcile such apparently contradictory facets. Nestled between the beaches and wooded hills, hedonism and meditation co-exist in this town that was the capital of Japan from 1192 for almost two centuries.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p style="text-align:justify">Given the easy access from Tokyo via a number of public transport options, the vast majority of visitors to Kamakura choose to stay in the capital and head here for a day trip. If it feels there&#39;s too much to see in one day, then one will be pleased to find a decent selection of accommodations in Kamakura itself. Down by the sea sit perhaps the most luxurious of the crop, with sea views high on the list of desires for those who stay here.

Featuring two UNESCO World Heritage sites, the town is often overlooked by first time visitors to Japan in favour of Kyoto and Nara. Uji is surrounded by forested hills with Uji River passing through the city. Uji was established in the 4th century by the semi mythical Emperor Ojin, who is said to have built a palace here. The city really came into prominence when Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu heavily promoted tea cultivation and production in the area during his 1358-1408 reigns. The area has since been well known for its superior taste and has some of the oldest tea shops in Japan. The first place to see has got to be Byodoin Temple, a Buddhist temple originally built over one thousand years ago in 998. Byodoin is one of the UNESCO World Heritage sites in Uji. The stunning temple, surrounded by a pond and with extremely distinct architectural touches, is in another league compared to most temples in Japan. Another UNESCO World Heritage site is Ujigami Shrine. This small but interesting shrine is said to be the oldest Shinto shrine in the world. It is a short walk across Uji River&#39;s red Japanese bridges and at the bottom of Daikichiyamafuchi Park. Those looking for a short hike can continue up the mountain to the park&#39;s summit for a view over Uji. Uji is also famous for its green tea. While Kozanji Temple in Kyoto is believed to be the original site of tea cultivation in Japan, Uji&#39;s tea became better known for its superior quality in the 1100s. Uji is the premier green tea manufacturing location in Japan, and visitors will see the name in shops and cafes all across the nation. The establishments in Uji offer not just traditional tea experiences, but everything from green tea ice cream to green tea biscuits. The Tale of Genji Museum is also worth visiting nearby for those interested in the story. A little out of the centre by bus is Mimurotoji Temple which is known for its expansive gardens. Mimurotoji draws the crowds for to its cherry blossoms in spring, azaleas in May, hydrangeas in June and lotus flowers in July and August.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p style="text-align:justify">The small and historical city of Uji has a modest collection of accommodations, but many of them provide an atmospheric stay. Traditional ryokan represent some of the most authentic and memorable places to stay here, with the most popular ones sitting on the western bank of the river. Elsewhere, a couple of simple hotels sit next to the main train station.

The largest city on Japan&#39;s northernmost island of Hokkaido Sapporo offers many great reasons to visit. Although travel to this largely hilly region only became fashionable after it hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the city is more than making up for it now with events such as the famous Sapporo Snow Festival, one of Japan&#39;s largest winter events attracting more than two million visitors every winter. In addition, the city regularly hosts important international sporting events as well as major political gatherings such as G8 Summits. Sapporo also plays a role as a major cultural destination and is home to some of Japan&#39;s best known culinary dishes, theatrical and musical events, as well as museums and lovely parks well worth including on your Japanese itinerary. Sapporo, located in the mountains and renowned for its cold brew, is one of the best places to visit in Japan for thrill seekers and adventure travellers. Sapporo hosts ice sculpture festivals, ski and snowboard competitions and is a prime base for athletes wanting to hit the slopes themselves. Sapporo&#39;s streets form a perfect grid pattern, which leaves plenty of room for green spaces, hence the large number of parks and gardens. In winter, when the city is carpeted with snow, life moves underground for the most part. All year round, Japan&#39;s fifth largest city boasts a lively night life. Other events happen annually in Sapporo, including a summer beer festival and a lilac celebration in the spring. Although relatively new and not known for its historic attractions, the city&#39;s broad tree lined boulevards, lush parks, ski resorts and vibrant nightlife make up for its lack of heritage. A Sapporo itinerary should include its famous beer gardens, landmark buildings and local delicacies such as miso ramen and white sweethearts, a type of chocolate biscuit.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p style="text-align:justify">Most of the hotels in Sapporo are centrally located and within walking distance of many of the local tourist attractions and restaurants, as well as being generally more affordable than those in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto.

Tourists will be able to choose from a variety of accommodation options for your stay in Sapporo, including opulent and upscale hotels.

Yokohama feels far more spacious and airy than the capital, thanks to its open harbour frontage and generally low rise skyline and though it can&rsquo;t claim any outstanding sights, the place has enough of interest to justify day&rsquo;s outing from Tokyo. Locals are proud of their city&rsquo;s international heritage and there&rsquo;s definitely a cosmopolitan flavour to the place, with its scattering of Western style buildings, Chinese temples and world cuisines and its sizeable foreign community. It might seem strange to come all this way to look at 19th century European style architecture, but the upmarket suburb of Yamate is one of the city&rsquo;s highlights, an area of handsome residences, church spires and bijou teashops. Yamate&rsquo;s exotic attractions still draw Japanese tourists in large numbers, as do the vibrant alleys and speciality restaurants of nearby Chinatown. There&rsquo;s a clutch of assorted museums along the seafront and north to where Kannai boasts a few grand old Western edifices, in complete contrast to the Minato Mirai 21 development&rsquo;s hi-tech skyscrapers in the distance. A century and a half ago Yokohama consisted of just a few fishermen&#39;s shacks on the banks of Tokyo Bay, 30 kms south of the capital. The sleepy village of 600 inhabitants was roused by the trade treaty between the US and Japan in 1850 and transformed into a major commercial port, going on to become Japan&#39;s second biggest city. This cosmopolitan hub has a Chinatown, European districts and a dazzling seafront development, Minato Mirai 21, which has its sights firmly set on the future. Japan&#39;s largest port city, Yokohama is an internationally minded community of splendid parks, thriving industry, sumptuous cuisine and a singular history.

Unlike in more expensive cities, there are numerous places where one can enjoy a very comfortable stay for very less price. Tourists can find plenty of budgets friendly accommodation options, such as dormitory style hostels, clustered around the Ishikawa-cho and Sakuragi-cho train stations, offering easy access to some of Yokohama&#39;s best known attractions.

The once fortified town of Fukuoka grew in importance during the 17th century and after amalgamation with Hakata in 1889 became an important cultural centre. These days, Fukuoka is home to numerous fine museums, art galleries and theatres, as well as sporting events and festivals, most notably the famous Hakata Gion Yamakasa a two week long, 700 year old celebration held each July that involves colourful parades, traditional races and costumes, along with musical offerings. Fukuoka also offers many interesting shopping opportunities, in particular in Canal City Hakata, a city within a city complete with a waterway running through a complex of hotels, restaurants, arcades, cinemas and a theatre. The largest city on the island, Fukuoka formed through the merger of two former cities that had grown up either side of the Naka River. Tracing its history as a trading port settlement back around 2000 years, a complex narrative of cultural exchange, feudal fighting, and regional trade has left the city with a number of interesting historical sites and folk traditions, which one can discover at a wealth of museums across the city. Fukuoka, to the north of Kyushu Island, is a dynamic city. It has its sights firmly set on the future, as illustrated by the ultra modern architecture in the Momochi district and an economy based on new technologies as well as the fantastic Asian Art Museum.

The city has a significant and interesting history, as it is Europe&rsquo;s historic capital as well as the capital of modern Greece. The city has been occupied by many conquerors throughout the centuries and many of these erected stunning monuments. Today the city is a bustling, modern metropolis, but charming historical features lie just below the surface. The historic city centre has been turned into a large pedestrian zone that provides access to many of the main archaeological parks, including the temple of Olympian Zeus, Hadrian&rsquo;s Arch, the ancient Theatre of Dionysis and many other sites. Athens is the capital and the largest city of Greece with its history of about 7000 years, an amalgamation of historic and the modern world can be seen throughout the city. Thanks to the 2004 Olympics, Athens is in much better shape than before. The city of Athens is surrounded by 4 large mountains Mt. Aigaleo to the west, Mt. Parnitha to the north, Mt. Pentelicus to the northeast and Mt. Hymettus to the east. The earliest settlements here began over 7000 years ago. Naturally, it became a centre for rulers to establish their kingdoms. Athens boasts of having two UNECSO world heritage sites, the Acropolis and Daphni monastery. The city is very vibrant. There are diverse options for shopping ranging from colourful bazaars to suburban malls. With an efficient transport system, exploring this great city is not a hassle at all. A symbol of Western Civilization at its most magnificent, Athens boasts an illustrious history that stretches back more than 3000 years. The city flourished during classical antiquity and was the birthplace of Socrates, Pericles and Sophocles. More than just a relic of its glorious past, today Athens is a bustling and modern capital city. The Acropolis is one of the world&#39;s most breathtaking ancient ruins and the city&#39;s exceptional archaeology museums display fascinating artefacts uncovered at local sites.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p style="text-align:justify"><br />\r\nAthens, being a tourist destination, offers places to stay in a full wide range of price spectrum.

Best places quickly fill up in the peak seasons of July and August. There are more than 350 hotels in the Greater Athens metropolitan area, ranging from backpackers&#39; hostels to five star beach resorts and from historic landmark buildings to contemporary high rises. The most important choice is about the location of the hotel.

On the other hand, if all needed is a comfortable bed and a warm meal, consider a budget friendly hostel or family run inn in the residential areas outside the city&#39;s central area. Like any city there are hotels of every category. There is a youth Hostel where beds are cheap.

Nearly three thousand years have passed since this area held the first Olympic Games in the shadow of the stately Mount Kronos, a tribute to the god, Zeus. The remains of temples honouring both Zeus and Hera can be found here, their graceful columns offering a picturesque ruin where one can wander freely. The flame for the modern Olympic Games is still lit in front of the Temple of Hera. The centrepiece of the site is the 200 mts track of the stadium itself, entered by way of a long arched tunnel. The vast sanctuary complex built to house competitors thousands of years ago has yielded a wealth of artefacts, exhibited in the on-site Olympia Archaeological Museum. The site itself is picturesque, but the sheer quantity of ruined structures can give a confusing impression of their ancient grandeur and function despite the crowds, tour buses, souvenir shops and other trappings of mass tourism, it deserves a visit with at least an overnight stay at the modern village of Olymbia.

The city has a myriad of attractions and is a great place to use as a base to explore southern Austria with absolutely jaw dropping landscapes and mountain scenery. Klagenfurt is situated in southern Austria, near the border with Slovenia, and is bounded on the south by the wooded ridge of the Sassnitz range, with the Karawanken rearing up behind. Founded in 1161 as a market town, Klagenfurt is famous for its extremely attractive Old Town quarter with its picturesque lanes, historical buildings and its many arcaded Renaissance courtyards with their trendy boutiques, galleries and cafes. It&#39;s also famous for the old moat and canal added between 1527 and 1558 and which still links Klagenfurt to the Worthersee, the area&#39;s largest lake. Also of interest are the city&#39;s old fortifications, marked by a circuit of streets known as the Ring, which circles the old part of the town and boasts many fine parks and gardens. As host of the Euro 2008 football tournament, Klagenfurt held its own as a host, showing that it was a dynamic city that knew how to party. Perhaps this is due to its Italian influences, which can be felt both in the city&#39;s architecture, with its pleasant courtyards and squares and in its food.

Although the centre is built up, the town is charmingly laid out on a peninsula between the Rivers Traun and Ischl.
